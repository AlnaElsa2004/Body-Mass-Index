# Body-Mass-Index

## Overview

This project utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict categorical outcomes based on a dataset featuring individuals' gender, height, and weight. By employing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, this project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using SVM. The goal is to showcase how SVM can effectively classify data and provide actionable insights.

## Project Description

The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' gender, height, weight, and an index. The objective is to predict the index based on the other features using the SVM classifier.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of the following columns:
- `Gender`: The gender of the individual (Male/Female)
- `Height`: The height of the individual in cm
- `Weight`: The weight of the individual in kg
- `Index`: The target variable (a categorical index value)


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn

```
